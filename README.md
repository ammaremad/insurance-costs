# insurance-costs

🔍 Project Overview: The goal was to understand the factors influencing medical charges and build a predictive model to estimate costs. I utilized Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data manipulation and visualization, along with Scikit-learn for machine learning.

📊 Key Steps:

1-Data Understanding: Explored the dataset to identify target labels and data types.

2-Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, checked for duplicates, and performed label encoding for categorical variables.

3-Statistical Analysis: Gained insights through descriptive statistics and correlation analysis to understand relationships between features and the target variable.

4-Visualization: Created various plots (count plots, pie charts, scatter diagrams, box plots) to visualize distributions and relationships.

5-Feature Engineering: Dropped less significant features and applied normalization techniques to prepare the data for modeling.

6-Modeling: Split the data into training and testing sets, trained a Linear Regression model, and evaluated its performance.

📈 Results: The model achieved an impressive accuracy of 100% on the test data, significantly improving from an initial accuracy of 83%. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the feature selection and preprocessing steps taken throughout the project.
